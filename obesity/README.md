# Obesity

### By Kate Medet

Obesity if becoming a global epidemic, and the United States is leading the in for this concerning trend.

### Biology
Obesity occurs when abnormal amounts of triglycerides are stored in adipose tissue and released from adipose tissue as free fatty acids with detrimental effects. Excess fat accumulation occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure, although individuals respond differently to this imbalance owing to genetic predisposition.

### Genetics
Dysfunction in genes responsible for the body's regulation of metabolism and apetite can contribute to the accumulation of fat and lead to obesity. Mutations in the MC4R, LEP, LEPR, and POMC genes can cause reduced expression of the proteins involved in the body's regulation of appetite, resulting in increased appetite and reduced satiety. Variants found near these genes can also cause reduced expression of these genes by controlling their expression at the DNA level.
