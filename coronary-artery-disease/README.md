# Coronary Atery Disease

Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. In the United States, CAD is the #1 cause of death for both men and women.

## Description
Coronary Artery Disease is caused by limitation of blood flow to the heart, which can cause the myocardial cells to die due to a lack of oxygen. CAD is the most common cause of death and disability globally. Most CAD can be prevented if established risk factors are avoided.

## Biology
Coronary Artery Disease happens when the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle, become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on the inner walls. As the amount of plaque builds up, less blood can flow through the arteries and as a result the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs.

## Genetics
Variants associated with CAD are found near genes that are associated with the following risk factors: LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, hypertension, and myocardial infarction. The majority of these genes are related to cholesterol and triglyceride homeostasis. These include, but are not limited to: LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, and LDA and their function is to reduce the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. Variants found near these genes affect their function and can cause an overall increase in LDL cholesterol found in the blood.

## Risk Factors
Common risk factors include: 
* Smoking
* Family history
* Hypertension
* Obesity
* Diabetes
* Lack of exercise
* Stress
