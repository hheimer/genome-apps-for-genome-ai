# Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by memory loss, cognitive decline, and personality changes. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of Alzheimer's disease, developing after age 65. Many factors, including genetics, can influence a person's chance of developing the condition. This test includes the most common genetic variant associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

## Biology

The rs429358 variant in the APOE gene is the most common genetic factor associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The APOE gene contains instructions for making a protein called apolipoprotein E. This protein helps control the levels of cholesterol and fats in the blood. It is not known exactly how the rs429358 variant increases the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
