# [Genome App](https://www.guardiome.com/genome-apps-index/): Tumor Supressors

Analyze major tumor suppressors genes

## Tumor suppressors keep tumors away
Sometimes cells go crazy (for example under high cellular stress). These crazy cells then divide rapidly and produce more crazy cells. 1 crazy leads to more crazies. And this is how tumors develop. To prevent this from happening, tumor suppressors prevent the cells from going crazy. Even if a cell has already gone crazy, tumor suppressors can still heal or kill the cell. So in a nutshell, tumor suppressors are the guardians of our cells.

## Tumor suppressor genes are - very - important
People with impaired tumor suppressors are more likely to develop diseaseas such as cancer. And since a tumor suppressor is a protein translated from RNA transcribed from DNA, the tumor suppressor gene, analyzing the status of the gene can provide important information about cell's tumor-suppressing capacity.

## This genome app analyzes tumor suppressor genes
This genome app checks for the statuses of the major tumor suppressor genes. Knowing the statuses is valuable because having impaired tumor suppressor genes increases the chance of getting cancers and other diseases.

## Angelina Jolie and her tumor suppressor BRCA1
Angelina Jolie checked for her tumor suppressor gene status and discovered that her BRCA1 gene (a tumor suppressor gene) was dysfunctional, making her more susceptable to cancers especially breast and ovarian cancers. So she reomved her brests and ovaries.

## Add extra tumor suppressor genes when making designer babies
Having impaired or no tumor suppressor genes means that there is less defence against tumor formation. In contrast, having functional tumor suppressor genes prodives more defence. So maybe, having more tumor suppressor genes can better guard our cells from going crazy. Perhaps we should add extra tumor suppressor genes to the genome of our designer babies (if you plan to make designer babies).
