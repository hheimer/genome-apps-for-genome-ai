# Hereditary Thrombophilia

Hereditary thrombophilia is a predisposition to developing harmful blood clots. These harmful blood clots most commonly form in the legs and can travel to the lungs. This test includes the two most common variants linked to hereditary thrombophilia.

## Biology

Hereditary thrombophilia is linked to variants in multiple genes including the F5 and F2 gene.

The F5 gene contains instructions for making a protein called coagulation factor V. When activated, factor V converts a protein called prothrombin into another protein called thrombin. Thrombin is important for forming blood clots. Certain variants in the F5 gene make the factor V protein harder to inactivate. This leads to more thrombin, which increases the chances of forming blood clots.

The F2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called prothrombin. Certain variants in the F2 gene causes it to become overactive and leads to the production of too much prothrombin. The abundance of prothrombin leads to more thrombin, which promotes the formation of blood clots.

## Symptoms

 * Pain, tenderness, swelling, or redness in one or both legs
 * Chest pain
 * Difficulty breathing
 * Hereditary thrombophilia may also be associated with recurrent late pregnancy loss in some women

## Treatment

Hereditary thrombophilia typically does not require any ongoing treatment. In some cases medications can= be used to prevent harmful blood clots form forming. Medications and surgery can also be used to break up existing clots.

## Prevalence

It is estimated that 1 in 20 people of European descent has a variant linked to hereditary thrombophilia. Around 1 in 1,000 people of European descent develops harmful blood clots each year. Some of these people have genetic variants and many others do not. Estimates are not as well known for people of other ethnicities.
