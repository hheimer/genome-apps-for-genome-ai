# Parkinson's Disease

Parkinson's disease is characterized by tremor, muscle stiffness, and problems with movement. Many factors, including genetics, can influence a person's chance of developing Parkinson's disease.

## Biology

Parkinson's disease is associated with many variants in many genes including LRRK2 and GBA.

The GBA gene contains instructions for making an enzyme that breaks down a large, fatty molecule called glucocereboside into simple sugars and fats. Certain variants in the GBA gene prevent the enzyme from functioning properly. Scientists do not know exactly how these variants increase the risk for Parkinson's disease.

The LRRK2 gene contains instructions for making an enzyme called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2, also called dardarin. This enzyme interacts with other proteins to tuen them on and off. Certain variants in the LRRK2 gene cause this enzyme to be too active, which prevents it from properly controlling other proteins.

## Symptoms

 * Tremor
 * Muscle stiffness
 * Slow movements
 * Problems with balance
 * Memory loss in some cases

## Treatment

There is currently no known prevention or cure for Parkinson's disease. Certain medications may be used to delay or ease symptoms. Speech, physical, and occupational therapies may also help with symptom management.

## Prevalence

Parkinson's disease affects people of all ethnicities. About 1 in 100 people develop Parkinson's disease during their lifetime.

## Risk Factors

 * Age
 * Sex
 * Family history
 * Exposure to certain chemicals
 * Physical activity
 * Head injury
 * Other genes
