# Genome Apps for Genome AI

This repository contains [Genome Apps](https://www.guardiome.com/apps-index/) :microscope: created by the open source Genome App community :earth_asia: and used by [Genome AI](https://www.guardiome.com/ai-index/) :no_mouth:.
All Genome Apps here are available for Genome AI users :family:.

## Adding your Genome App

If you have a Genome App that you want to contribute (all Genome AI users will be able to run your Genome App :dancers:), add your Genome App here in 3 steps :feet:: (TODO: Add video showing the entire process)
1. Make sure your Genome App name is unique. There should not already be a Genome App with the same name here; if so, simply rename yours.
2. Click "Upload new files" and drag-and-drop your Genome App here:


3. Create a pull request (TODO: Add screenshot)

## Updating your Genome App

If your Genome App is already here and you want to update it, do so in 2 steps :feet::
1. Update your Genome App name with a version number. If this is the first time you're updating your Genome App, add "v2" to the end of your Genome App name. If you've already added "v2" of your Genome App here, add "v3" to the end of your Genome App name, and so on.
2. Follow steps 2 and 3 under [Adding your Genome App here](#adding-your-genome-app-here)


:tada: Congratulations - you've made accessing DNA more exciting for people :notes::family::notes:
