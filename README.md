# [Genome Apps](https://www.guardiome.com/apps-index/) :microscope: for [Genome AI](https://www.guardiome.com/ai-index/) :no_mouth:

This repository contains genome apps for Genome AI. All genome apps here are available for Genome AI users :family:.

## Adding your genome app here

If you have a genome app that you want to contribute (all Genome AI users will be able to run your genome app :dancers:), add your genome app here in :three: steps :feet:: (TODO: Add video showing the entire process)
1. Make sure your genome app name is unique. There should not already be a genome app with the same name here; if so, simply rename yours.
2. Drag-and-drop your genome app here (TODO: Add screenshot)
3. Create a pull request (TODO: Add screenshot)

:tada: Congratulations - you've made accessing DNA more exciting for people :family::notes:
