# Lactose Tolerance

Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese contain the sugar lactose. An enzyme called lactase breaks down this sugar. If you don't produce enough lactase, your gut bacteria will breakdown the lastose producing gas, causing indigestion.

## Biology

Lactase is made by infants so that they can digest their mother's milk. Most people lose the ability to produce lactase during childhood and may experience symptoms of lactose intolerance. But some people who don't make much lactase can still enjoy dairy products without a problem.

## Genetics

The LCT gene contains instructions for making the lactase enzyme. A nearby region of DNA helps determine whether the LCT gene keeps producing lactase or not. People who inherit two copies of a variant in this region don't make lactase as adults and are typically lactose intolerant.

## Risk Factors

 * Age
 * Ancestry
