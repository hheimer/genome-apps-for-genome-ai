# Sleep Cycle

The body's biological clock controls the daily rhythms of processes such as the sleep-wake cycle. Genetic factors in these biological clock genes can influence a person's preference for mornings or evenings.

## Genetics

PER3 is a core component of the primary circadian pacemaker in the brain. Some variants in PER3 may lead to dysregulation of the sleep and circadian clock systems.
