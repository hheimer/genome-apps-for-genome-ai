# Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

AAT deficiency is a genetic condition that can lead to lung and liver disease. It is caused by decreased leveled of the alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) protein. This test includes the two most common variants linked ot this deficiency.

## Biology

AAT deficiency is caused by variants in the SERPINA1 gene. The SERPINA1 gene contains instructions for making a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). This protein is made in the liver, but is transported to the lungs where it has a protective function. Certain variants in SERPINA1 result in too little AAT protein getting transported to the lungs, and more AAT protein getting trapped in the liver. As a result, the lungs are less protected form damage, and the liver can become damaged as well.

## Symptoms

 * Shortness of breath and wheezing
 * Chronic cough
 * Recurrent lung infections
 * Lung disease, including emphysema
 * Liver disease, including cirrhosis

## Treatment

There is currently no known cure. People with AAT deficiency are encourage to avoid smoking and consider getting certain vaccinations. For those with symptoms, treatment focuses on management of lung and liver problems. Direct replacement of the AAT protein into blood may be used to slow the progression of lung disease. Lung and liver transplants may be beneficial in some cases.

## Prevalence

AAT deficiency is most common in people of Northern European descent. In the U.S., 1 in 3,000-5,000 people has this condition.

## Risk Factors

 * Smoking
 * Occupational and other exposures
 * Personal or family history of lung disease
 * Viral infections
