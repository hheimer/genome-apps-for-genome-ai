## Background

Alcohol flush reaction is a condition in which individuals, following consumption of alcohol, develop a reddening of the skin on the face, upper body, and in some cases the whole body. It is colloquially known as "Asian Flush" or "Asian Blush" due to the fact that a significant portion of East Asians (Korean, Japanese, and Chinese) experience this physical reaction.<sup>1</sup> The cause of these symptoms comes from genetic differences in a breakdown enzyme known as dehydrogenase — those affected with the condition carry a variant that speeds up the breakdown of alcohol into a toxic byproduct known as acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde is responsible for the physical manifestation of skin blotchiness/reddness.<sup>2</sup>

## Did you know?

Those that carry the ALDH2 enzyme variant, i.e. those who experience alcohol flush reaction, on average are less likely to suffer from alcoholism as a result of the negative physical effects of consuming alcohol.<sup>2</sup>

## Where does this Genome App look?

This analysis looks at your genetic information presented at the rs671 single-nucleotide polymorphism — located on the ALDH2 gene of chromosome 12.<sup>3</sup>
