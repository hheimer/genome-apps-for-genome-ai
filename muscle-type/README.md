# Muscle Type

### About this Genome App
This Genome App looks for a specific variant in the ACTN3 gene on chromosome 11 that impairs muscle performance. If you have two copies of this variant, you're likely to be an endurance athlete. If you don't have this variant, you're likely a sprinter. And if you have one copy of this variant, your muscles are somewhere in the middle :/
