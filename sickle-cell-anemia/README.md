# Sickle Cell Anemia

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disorder characterized by anemia, episodes of pain, and frequent infections. A person must have two copies of the rs334 variant in the HBB gene in order to have this condition.

# Genetics

Sickle cell anemia is caused by the rs334 variant in the HBB gene. The HBB gene contains instructions for making a protein called beta-globin. This protein is part of a larger protein called hemoglobin that is found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin transports oxygen from the lungs to all other cells of the body. Certain variants in HBB alter the structure of hemoglobin, making it defective in transporting oxygen.
